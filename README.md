## Intro
  As we have enormous amount of data flowing in the social media like reddit everyday, it is important that one must be up to date about the important issues. However, understanding a post belongs to which class of subreddit is really important; as we donâ€™t want to waste our time on unimportant posts. This problem can be solved by creating a simple subreddit category prediction model.

### The objective of the Predictive model:
- Determine subreddit class of particular post,
- Maximize prediction score high as possible


### Implementation instructions -
Run 'dataPreprocessing.py' file
It will ask whether you want to build word cloud. If yes, specify the name of subreddit for word cloud(This is extra feature).
After the word cloud, console will ask for
Number of subreddits to classify and
Names of subreddits.

It will send the control to 'redditClassifier.py' file for implematation of actual training models and predictions.
